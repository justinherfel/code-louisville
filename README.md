This is a photo and video gallery of a cross-country trip I took, movinf from Los Angeles to Louisville in 2020. This is a single web page that highlights some of my favorite pictures and one video from the journey. I started with a mobile-first approach, and included two media queries.

The first media query is designed for tablets, and the second media query is designed for desktop computers. Starting from a phone screen view, you'll see the menu items are stacked on top of each other below the J-PHOTO text, in a column. All the images, captions, and videos are also stacked in a single column. When expanded out to tablet view, the menu items at the top move into a row below the J-PHOTO text, and a small space on either side of the gallery appears. When expanded to desktop view, the menu items move to the upper right side of the page, and the J-PHOTO text moves to the left side of the page. The photo gallery moves to a two-column view. 

For my CSS features, the menu bar at the top switches between vertical and horizontal styles as the screen is expanded or contracted. And the photo gallery switches from one column to two column when the screen expands to desktop size.

For the JavaScript feature, I created a custom web player to play a video of a rainstorm coming in the desert. I created custom player buttons that are functional. The play button and pause button toggle depending on the video's play state, and this is similar for the audio button as well, depending on the video's audio state. The fullscreen button also toggles between a fullscrdeen and non-fullscreen state on click. The video slider bar also pauses when touched and moved, and the slider shows the progress of the video as it plays. The audio slider is also fully functional, and moves the volume up and down on mouse drag.

Thank you!
